# BayesLogit 2.2 (2025-06-27)

- Minor edits to comply with CRAN NOTEs in CITATION.
- Minor edits to NEWS.md to avoid CRAN NOTE about NEWS.md.

# BayesLogit 2.1 (2019-09-25)

- BayesLogit has been completely re-organized. Previously, the package was
  derived from a repository used for a doctoral thesis, and included many
  items beyond what was necessary for an R package. This made the
  subsequent package difficult to maintain.
  The new package and repository (<https://github.com/jwindle/BayesLogit>)
  has been slimmed down and now is focused on implementation of PolyaGamma
  sampling methods.
  Thanks go to Jari Oksanen and James Balamuta for their help in getting
  thepackage ready for CRAN.
